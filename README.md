blackjack-sim
=========

Javascript BlackJack simulator. Work in Progress.

Eventually it's becoming (hopefully) a full featured and configurable blackjack risk-calculator, to be used in various casinos. 

Forked from https://github.com/scottux/BlackJack for its nice & clean Card(), Deck() and Hand() functions.
 
 Now also an API on Decks of Cards available: http://deckofcardsapi.com/
